      "|It was an interesting time. It was a learning curve for me. If the whole idea was to get into a room with a casting director and make an impression I did what I came for. They've seen my work and have me in mind, so I've achieved that. I came back thinking it was the most impossible thing to do, there's no chance of me ever kind of making it there. But I came back and thought if I put in the hard work and keep on doing what I'm doing it is doable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n",

    "The list of the words considered for censorship removal was taken from https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/. The list was filtered by running profanity_check on all the words, selecting those with profanity probability higher than 0.9 and then manually removing ones which are unlikely to be censored or appear in the quotations. The method for censorship removal is based on regular expressions and consists of two stages. In the first stage we detect censorship by constructing a large regular expression that covers two types of censorship that we consider, the \"middle\" censorship and the \"end\" censorship:\n",
    " - The \"middle\" censorship includes all the censorship styles that keep the first and the last letter of the word and add ann arbitrary number of censorship characters in the middle e.g. F**k.\n",
    " - In the censorship styles that we categorize as the \"end\" censorship, first $n$ characters of the word are visible, while the other $l - n$ ($l$ is the number of characters in the word) characters, are replaced with less than or equal to $l - n$ censorship characters e.g. F--.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second stage we firstly construct a dictionary where the keys are profanities and the values are regular expressions that represent the profanity in different censorship styles. We then iterate through the keys of the dictionary, replacing each matched dictionary value (in this the values are regular expressions) with the corresponding key."

It is an election where either years from now we will hopefully forget one candidate and leave him in the dustbin of history or where we will be pounding our chests for not having yelled loud enough to stop him. This is not politics as usual. This is not Republican vs. Democrat. This is not liberal vs. conservative. This is a choice between someone who denigrates women, foreigners, the handicapped and tolerates haters, xenophobes and anti Semites and one who doesn't.

    "Profanity check is not perfect. Although in the [documentation](https://pypi.org/project/profanity-check/), the author reports high results on the Wikipedia comments dataset, we don't have any guarantee that the model would perform well on the data from a different distribution. Thus, we radically set the profanity score threshold to 0.9, to reduce the number of false positives as much as possible. We also label all the censored quotes as profane, even though our censorship removal method is also not perfect. Funally, we use the same bad words list as before and consider all the words for which profanity score calculated by profanity_check exceeds 0.5. We then filter the set by manually, removing implausible words."
